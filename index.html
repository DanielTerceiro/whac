            <h3>Facts and a bit of the history of the game</h3>
               <ul>
                <li>Whac a Mole was invented in 1975 by Kazuo Yamada of TOGO, based on ten of the designer's pencil sketches from 1974.
                    TOGO released it as Mogura Taiji to Japanese amusement arcades in 1975.</li>
                <li>It was later licensed to Bandai in 1977.</li>
                <li>In the late 1970s, arcade centers in Japan began to be flooded with "mole buster" games, where players used a 
                    foam mallet to hit plastic moles that popped out of the machine.Whac a Mole has since been commonly found at 
                    Japanese festivals.</li>
                <li>Whac a Mole made its North American debut in November 1976 at the International Association of Amusement Parks
                    and Attractions (IAAPA) show, where it drew attention for being the first mallet game of its type. </li>
                <li>Gerald Denton and Donny Anderson saw the Japanese game, and decided they wanted to adapt it into a carnival 
                    game by putting it in a trailer, with Denton also showing it to Aaron Fechter at the same show.
                    Denton assigned Fechter the task of building their own version of the game, with Fechter coining the name 
                    "Whac-A-Mole" and adding air cylinders, "so that when air pushed up the moles, 
                    the air acted as a cushion."</li>
                <li>Fechter developed the prototype in 1977, with Denton and Anderson 
                    presenting it to the founder of Bob's Space Racers, Bob Cassata, the same year. After Bob made further 
                    refinements to the game, Bob's Space Racers made its first sale of the game in 1977.</li>
                <li>In 1978, it debuted at a midway exhibition show, where it was the most popular game. The following year, 
                    it debuted at pinball parlours. In 1980, it was sold in the carnival, amusement park and coin-op arcade markets.
                     Whac-A-Mole has since become a popular carnival game.</li>
